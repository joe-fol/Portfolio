# My Portfolio

A simple React website to showcase some of my work completed on the nology course. This was my second shot
at building a website from scratch.

I used React as the framework as it gave the me the ability to modularize my code and keep things relatively dry.
I built my own carousel using state rather than bootstrapping one.
